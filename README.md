Definition of growth mindset:
> Growth mindset is a mindset that challenges what you already know, and encourages the idea that hard work and failing up will foster progress and ultimately success

### 3 ways to stay in growth mindset:
- Ask for help if you need it, collaboration is KEY
- Take breaks, come back to a problem with a fresh perspective and new energy
- Expect to fail! You learn just as much- if not more- from your mistakes as you do your successes
