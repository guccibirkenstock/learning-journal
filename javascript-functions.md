its being viewed in the browswer
- js can help you create forms, slideshows, fliter data, or even reload specific parts of a page 
- a *script* is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal
- to write a script, you need to state a goal, list every task that needs to be completed in order to meet that goal, and then
code each each step it takes to complete those tasks.  Each goal may and will require multiple tasks to be completed, and each
task might have multiple steps that need to be taken to complete the task.
(ideally keep in mind which steps go first second third etc. when writing up your goal and tasks)
- an *expression* evaluates into (results in) a single value. broadly speaking, there are two types of expressions
1. expressions that just assign a value to a variable `ex: var color = 'beige' ;`
1. expressions that use two or more values to return a single value `ex: var area = 3 * 2 ;`
