# CSS
- CSS allows us to style whole blocks, or sections of html script
- CSS rule contains two parts
> 1. selector: indicates which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to multiple elements, but you *must seperate eachelement name with a comma* {p}
> 2. declaration: indicates how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.  Split into two parts, the *property* and *value*
> property: indicates the aspects of the elements you want to change (ex. color, font, width, height etc.){font-family}
> value: specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties (ex. specify color, font size value etc.){Arial}
```
EXAMPLE
p{
  font-family: Arial;}
```
