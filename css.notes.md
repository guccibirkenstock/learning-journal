# CSS
- CSS allows us to style whole blocks, or sections of html script
- CSS rule contains two parts
1. selector: indicates which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to multiple elements, but you *must seperate eachelement name with a comma*
1. declaration: indicates how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.  Split into two parts, the *property* and *value*
