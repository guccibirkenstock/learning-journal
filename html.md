### Target Audience
- Every site should be designed for a target audience
- Even if the site has a wide appeal, you can still think about the demographics of a sample of the target audience.
- One way to get design inspiration and make sure your priorities are where they should be, is by creating some fictional profiles for the people that would visit your site (gender, age, location, occupation, income, web use). When developing or brainstorming new features, think about wether or not your fictional visitors would want or use that feature.
- Think about the needs your customers are trying to fulfill by visiting your site
