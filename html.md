# HTML notes

### Target Audience
- Every site should be designed for a target audience
- Even if the site has a wide appeal, you can still think about the demographics of a sample of the target audience.
- One way to get design inspiration and make sure your priorities are where they should be, is by creating some fictional profiles for the people that would visit your site (gender, age, location, occupation, income, web use). When developing or brainstorming new features, think about wether or not your fictional visitors would want or use that feature.
- Think about the needs your customers are trying to fulfill by visiting your site

### Site Maps
> site map:  a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. 
- will usually begin with the homepage
- large and compartmentalized websites might have multiple groups of seperate pages, each group needing a home page to link all related information together
- to help decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called *card sorting*

> card sorting: placing each piece of information that a visitor might need to know on a seperate piece of paper and then organizing the related information into groups
- each group relates to a page
- on larger sites, pages can be grouped as well in order to create different sections of the website
