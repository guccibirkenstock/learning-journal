# How computers work
computers...
- recieve *input*.  input is information given by the user that tells the computer to do stuff (literally endless possibilities)
(ex, pluggin a number in on a calculator, pressing the home button on your iPhone etc.)
- stores input information to their *memory/storage*.
- have a *processor* that takes input information from storage, manipulates it using an *algorithm (series of commands*, and
sends the processed information back to memory to be stored again.  This continues until the processed information is ready to be
- *output* (ex. text, photos, video, games, VR etc.)
-when computers connect, the output of one computer becomes the input of the other and vis versa
### Bits
- computers process information in binary
- any number can be represented by 1's and 0's
- all types of information can be represented by numbers
- a *bit* is the smallest piece of information a computer can recieve/store
- tiny electric wires turn on and off in combinations representing 1's and 0's
- these tiny signals can be used to represent any type of information or input with two options such as 
yes or no, true or false, on or off, 1 or 0 etc.

### circuits and logic
- circuits take multiple forms of input data, manipulate and/or combine them (manipulate combine 10000101001 w/ 10100101100), and output the results
- logics are simple circuit pieces that represent very simple pieces of information (and, or etc), circuits are made up of many
*logic gates* that are able to process and output results from input

### CPU, memory, input and output
-input information is converted into binary, stored in the memory, and then sent to the CPU which processes the information 
with algorithms.  The CPU then figures out how to display the data in outputtems that recieve input and/or ou
- modern computers often have multiple CPUs to help the process lare amounts of information and many gigabytes of memory 
to store it

### hardware and software
- *hardware* is the physical computer/accessory that holds the software
- *software* is all of the computer programs or code. software tells the CPU what to do
- the CPU recieves simple commands to tell it what circuit to use to perform a specific task
-only one piece of software can be run by the CPU at one time HOWEVER...
- memory holds the *operating system* which switches the attention of the CPU between different software programs for a fraction
of a second each, basically allowing multiple pieces of software to run at the same time
