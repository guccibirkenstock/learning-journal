## Choosing a Text Editor
A text editor is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a webstie.  Choosing a text editor is a very personal choice, you should choose the program that allows for the smoothest workflow for YOU. Most important features to look for:
1. code completion
1. syntax highlighting
1. a variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
1. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them

Emmit is a shorthand language for html and CSS that speeds up your code writing.  Some editors have Emmit built in, some you can add on as a plugin
