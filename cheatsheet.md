# MY CHEAT SHEET

## Choosing a Text Editor
A text editor (or code editor) is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a webstie.  Choosing a text editor is a very personal choice, not all text editors are created equal.  Some code editors are designed for specific languages. You should choose the program that allows for the smoothest workflow for YOU. Most important features to look for:
1. code completion
1. syntax highlighting
1. a variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
1. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them

Emmit is a shorthand language for html and CSS that speeds up your code writing.  Some editors have Emmit built in, some you can add on as a plugin

## The Command line/terminal/cli(command line interface)
- A command line, also called _terminal_, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
- a terminal is a developer tool that you can do a lot on, its a way of talking to the computer
- non-GUI,
- GUI: graphical user interface, looks like going through folders and locations in the Finder in order to find the file

file explorer tasks (done in GUI): (you can do all this as a terminal task, and much much more...)
- find files
- change directories
- move and copy files
- open files
- make new files/ folders

Some commands to memorize

- "ls" list
- ". ~" shortcut to home directory
- "." reference to current directory
- ".." references parent directory
- "cd" change directory
- "mkd" make a directory
- "rm" remove (use with extreme caution!)
- "code." opens vs code
- "touch" creates a new file
